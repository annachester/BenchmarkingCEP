exp-1-rates:
plots for results of experiment 1: general setup with varying rates (200k, 1mln)
fixed selectivity (10%)

exp-2-sel:
plots for results of experiment 2: setup with varying selectivities (0.1%, 1%, 10%, 10% skewed)
fixed selectivity (10%)

all plots exist for both throughput ("_tput.png") and latency ("_lat.png")

further descriptions of the plots are integrated into the plotting.ipynb notebook! Look at that with care I put effort into the structure and discriptions :)
